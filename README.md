<!-- Introduction -->

This test is quite a challenge for me, to be honest I don't really think I can go as far as I did. I'm lucky that I have friends that I can consult with and whom can teach me, especially in regards to new concepts that I have zero understanding of at the beginning of this test. The project is definitely still incomplete as I was running out of time, but I will definitely come back to this in the near future and finish it. Other than that, this is a very good learning experience for me.

<!-- What did I learn -->

I learn how to use React Hook Form and Styled Components for the first time.

A lot of the concept in react-hook-form is very confusing at the beginning, still confusing even now, but practice makes perfect.
I'm using useForm hook with the register, watch, handleSubmit, setValue, and getValues method. All of these are completely new to me and I spent a lot of time reading and trying to understand the documentation. Consulting with friends help a lot in this case, in which they taught me the concept from the beginning and how to implement it.

My understanding of Styled Components is okay. This is also a new concept to me. My mindset on styling is still stuck on having it all on one css file and then applying them by class name or by child elements. As such, the styled components applied in this project is quite messy and redundant. I still need to try to switch my head around to think about the components first, and then style them accordingly in order to utilize styled components better.

<!-- What else can be improved -->

Modularity and readability especially need to be further improved. I've no experience in making a lot of projects and this is also the first project where I was chased by deadline. As such, I was writing the code quite messily and then spent a lot of time later trying to fix it. My understanding on how to pass data around components also need to be improved, which can only be done by practice.
